  This study explored the use of neural networks to solve
  ordinary differential equations, leveraging the Universal
  Approximation Theorem. Using a trial solution method,
  neural networks were employed to approximate solutions to
  differential equations by directly incorporating the
  equations into the cost function. This approach bypasses
  the need for training data, as the network learns
  solutions that naturally satisfy the equation to be
  solved. Finally, this methodology was applied to ordinary
  differential equations in nonlinear optics, such as those
  describing soliton-type solutions of the nonlinear
  Schr√∂dinger equation and the complex Ginzburg-Landau
  equation, where different models were tested and compared.
  The results highlight the potential of neural networks to
  accurately solve nonlinear boundary value problems.
